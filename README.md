# Hide chicken

hide-chicken is a mini Python tool that allows you to conceal a secret phrase within an image. With hide-chicken, you can hide your confidential message within an image, making it invisible to the naked eye. When you share this image with someone, they can use hide-chicken to extract the hidden message. It's a funny project.
